  <div class="about">
    <p>Lucain Miller is a 22 year old living in Vancouver, WA. They've played D&D concistantly for 3 years and enjoy every second of it. They've played 4 characters: Chad, the lizardfolk wild magic sorcerer. Balsam, the aasimar divine soul sorcerer. Tacita, the changeling circle of the shepherd druid. And Pokie Avis, a tegu bard that was used one their first try of pathfinder. They have played Balsam for the longest amount of time, which has been almost their entiredy of their D&D playing career, and Chad the shortest who has only been used for a total of 6 hours during 2 ones-shots.</p>

    <p>Lucain has always been a player when it comes to D&D but wants to try DMing in the near future. They have always enjoyed character creation and writing, so it seems like the logical path for them to take.</p>
